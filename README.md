MACHINE LEARNING MODEL END TO END DEPLOYMENT USING FLASK AND HTML

In this project I had built a model to predict the student marks using simle linear regression and for the students to check there predicted marks I had made the interface easy for the students by building a web application using FLASK and HTML

Steps that I have done to build this project

1- Understand the business case

2- Collect the data

3- Data cleaning

4- Split the data

5- check for overfitt and underfit

6- Traing score & testing score

7- Build the future prediction

8- Joblib data pipeline

9- To the pass this model using pipeline we pickle the lr model

10- Understand the FLASK 

11- FLASK with API (application user interface)

12- Using flask we create the http://
